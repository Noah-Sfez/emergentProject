        comment: "COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: Both demo login buttons work perfectly. Admin login (admin@demo.com/admin123) and Family Member login (member@demo.com/member123) both successfully authenticate, redirect to appropriate dashboards, and display success toast messages. Toast messages are properly implemented using react-hot-toast with ID '_rht_toaster'. Network requests to /api/auth/login are successful. No console errors detected. Login flow is fully functional."
